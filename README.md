# Generation Based Load Management System To Prevent Future Blackouts In Bangladesh
On November 2, 2014, Bangladesh experienced a complete nationwide blackout that lasted nearly 12 hours. The root cause was traced back to a power transmission overload at the Bheramara substation, part of the high-voltage link importing electricity from India. While the substation was rated to handle a maximum of 400 MW, it received 445 MW, triggering a technical failure. This led to a sudden drop in system frequency and initiated a cascading failure across the national grid, ultimately forcing all power plants offline and plunging the entire country into darkness.

Despite the presence of grid synchronization and Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems in many countries, Bangladesh lacks a sufficient operating reserve to effectively use these traditional methods for blackout prevention. Hence, the incident highlighted a critical need for a more suitable, locally adaptable solution.
